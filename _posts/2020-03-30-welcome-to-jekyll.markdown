Been meaning to try my hand at writing. 

Also wanted to try out some of the existing tools to host static pages and Jekyll with Prose seemed like a clean option (Didn't really look into other options). To be honest, it took a lot longer than I thought it would to set it up, primarily facing multiple issues centered around lost access to my primary github account and, amongst other things, in general being out of sync with installing things from a CLI.
