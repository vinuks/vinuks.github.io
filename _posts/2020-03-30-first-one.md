Been meaning to try my hand at writing. 

Also wanted to try out some of the existing tools to host static pages and Jekyll with Prose seemed like a clean option (Didn't really look into other options). To be honest, it took a lot longer than I thought it would to set it up, primarily facing multiple issues centered around lost access to my primary github account and, amongst other things, in general being out of sync with installing things from a CLI.

The main reasons for writing this blog are the following:
- I've read from experts (Twitter) that the best way to improve one's writing is to write.
- Easiest way to learn a topic is to force yourself to explain it to someone else.
- Keep abreast of ML research
- Force myself to learn topics in ML that I'm unaware of (Which is most of it to be honest)
- This could, in theory, serve as training data for abstractive summarization. (Optimistic)
